# arxiv-podcast
Axion and Neutrino robot podcast for a daily arXiv digest

If you want to make your own, please use the python script and change it however you like! Right now it looks for mentions of axions and neutrinos, and it has toggles to turn on generative AI and emailing that are both set to False. But you can change the key words and add in your own domain and email and API keys to make your own podcast.

This podcast uses MacOS voices. You would need to make some minor changes to use other voices.
